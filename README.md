## Project Title: DP-GAN for Privacy-Preserving Data Generation

### Introduction:
This project aims to implement a Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (DP-GAN) for privacy-preserving data generation. The GAN architecture is trained on a dataset containing information about diabetes patients, with the goal of generating synthetic data that closely resembles the original data while preserving the privacy of the individuals.

### Dependencies:
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `tensorflow_privacy`
  
### Differential Privacy
The project utilizes the tensorflow_privacy library to achieve differential privacy during the training of the GAN model. This library provides tools for implementing differential privacy in machine learning algorithms, ensuring that the privacy of individuals in the dataset is preserved while still allowing for meaningful analysis.

### Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
3. Open the notebook in Google Colab or any other compatible environment.
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and generate the results.

### Code Overview:
- The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries and mounting Google Drive to access the dataset.
- The dataset containing information about diabetes patients is loaded and preprocessed.
- A GAN architecture is defined, consisting of a generator and a discriminator.
- The GAN is trained on the dataset to generate synthetic data.
- Various experiments are conducted to evaluate the quality and privacy of the generated data.
- Results are visualized using box plots and scatter plots.

### Results:
- The notebook presents variations in test accuracies and Îµ-Identifiability scores with different dataset sizes.
- Box plots and scatter plots are used to visualize the results, demonstrating the trade-off between data quality and privacy.
